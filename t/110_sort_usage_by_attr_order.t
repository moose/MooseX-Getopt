# The usage information prints the 'documentation' value for all Getopt
# attributes, except the order is not deterministic (rather, it uses the order
# in which the attributes are stored in the metaclass 'attributes' hash).
# Let's sort them by insertion order, which should lead to nicer output:
# If MooseX::Getopt is applied early, the help options will be on top
# the help options will always be on top (assuming this role is applied
# early), followed by options added by parent classes and roles, and then
# options added by this class.
